# Casio_VX-4_RAM_Upgrade
NOTE: I would not reccomend making PCBs form the current posted version. I found the zebra strip contact
pads were about 0.5mm too far from end to end. This was the result of an odd problem with Eagle where
it was reading from a 'part.lbr. file in the project directory when editing the footprint but from the
component library when gnerating the PCB. I have fixed the PCB and have some new ones ordered. I will
upload the new PCB version after I'm able to build and test a few boards.
